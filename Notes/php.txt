PHP
- general purpose programming language
- object oriented
PHP interpreter - reads files and looks for dynamic content and outputs whatever was generated and sends it back as an http response
PHP files are similar to JSP files, they're mostly markup.
<?php
	echo "asdkjlh";
>
^ anything inside the php block is generated by PHP interpreter/s

<?php
	if (true){
	?>
	
	<?php
	}
?>
^ it is possible to move in and out of php scripts

private $prodID, $description - ALL variables start with $
public function _construct - for PHP constructors
- arrays are dynamically sized in PHP
$this -> totalAmount() - to call a function in PHP
- ARRAY SPLICE = array_splice()
- SUPER GLOBALS = variables that can be accessed anywhere
$_GLOBAL
<form action = "x.php" method=GET>
	<input type = "text" name = 'abc'>
	<input type = "submit">
