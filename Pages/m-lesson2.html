			Versions of CSS

			<ul class = "content">
				<details class = "CSS1">
						<summary>CSS 1</summary>
						<p class = "CSS">CSS1 is a simple style sheet mechanism that allows authors and readers to attach style (e.g. fonts, colors and spacing) to HTML documents. The CSS1 language is human readable and writable, and expresses style in common desktop publishing terminology.

						One of the fundamental features of CSS is that style sheets cascade; authors can attach a preferred style sheet, while the reader may have a personal style sheet to adjust for human or technological handicaps. The rules for resolving conflicts between different style sheets are defined in this specification.</p>

						</details>
				<details class = "CSS2">
						<summary>CSS 2</summary>
						<p class = "CSS">CSS2 came out in 1998, and contained a lot of the features that designers had been longing for. Boxes could be made to behave like HTML table cells, or they could be positioned in different ways; more powerful selectors were available; style sheets could be imported into other style sheets; style rules could be specific to certain output media; and so on. Vast improvements had also been made in the areas of paged media (printing), and the generation of content from the style sheet.</p>

						</details>
					<details class = "CSS3">
						<summary>CSS 3</summary>
						<p class = "CSS">Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.</p>

						</details>
                <details class = "CSS3">
						<summary>CSS 4</summary>
						<p class = "CSS">There is no single CSS4 specification and there is no standard which named as CSS4. But a few level 4 modules exist such as Image Values, Backgrounds & Borders, or Selectors etc., which build on the functionality of a preceding level 3 module. The level 4 modules can collectively be referred to as CSS level 4 . There is only CSS standard, and each module can level up independently.</p>
