			<h2>HTTP Message Headers</h2>
			<h3>General Header Fields</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Headers applying to both requests and responses but with no relation to the data eventually transmitted in the body.</li>
			</ul>
			<table>
				<tr><th>Header name</th>		<th>Description</th></tr>
				<tr><td>Cache-control</td>		<td>Used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request/response chain.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Connection</td>			<td>Allows the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection and MUST NOT be communicated by proxies over further connections.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Date</td>			<td>Represents the date and time at which the message was originated, having the same semantics as orig-date in RFC 822. </td></tr>
				<tr><td>Pragma</td>			<td>Used to include implementation- specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request/response chain</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Trailer</td>			<td>Indicates that the given set of header fields is present in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer-coding.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Transfer-encoding</td>		<td>Indicates what (if any) type of transformation has been applied to the message body in order to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Upgrade</td>			<td>Allows the client to specify what additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Via</td>			<td>Must be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients between the user agent and the server on requests, and between the origin server and the client on responses.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Warning</td>			<td>Used to carry additional information about the status or transformation of a message which might not be reflected in the message.</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h3>Request Header Fields</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Headers containing more information about the resource to be fetched or about the client itself.</li>
			</ul>
			<table>
				<tr><th>Header name</th>		<th>Description</th></tr>
				<tr><td>Accept</td>			<td>Can be used to specify certain media types which are acceptable for the response. Accept headers can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Accept-charset</td>		<td>Can be used to indicate what character sets are acceptable for the response. This field allows clients capable of understanding more comprehensive or special- purpose character sets to signal that capability to a server which is capable of representing documents in those character sets.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Accept-encoding</td>		<td>Similar to Accept, but restricts the content-codings that are acceptable in the response.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Accept-language</td>		<td>Similar to Accept, but restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Authorization</td>		<td>Authentication credentials for HTTP authentication.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Expect</td>			<td>Indicates that particular server behaviors are required by the client.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>From</td>			<td>SHOULD contain an Internet e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user agent.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Host</td>			<td> Specifies the Internet host and port number of the resource being requested, as obtained from the original URI given by the user or referring resource.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>If-Match</td>			<td>Used with a method to make it conditional. A client that has one or more entities previously obtained from the resource can verify that one of those entities is current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the If-Match header field.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>If-Modified-Since</td>		<td>Used with a method to make it conditional: if the requested variant has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will be returned without any message-body.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>If-None-Match</td>		<td>Used with a method to make it conditional. A client that has one or more entities previously obtained from the resource can verify that none of those entities is current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the If-None-Match header field. The purpose of this feature is to allow efficient updates of cached information with a minimum amount of transaction overhead.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>If-Range</td>			<td>Allows a client to "short-circuit" the second request. Informally, its meaning is `if the entity is unchanged, send me the part(s) that I am missing; otherwise, send me the entire new entity'.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>If-Unmodified-Since</td>	<td>Used with a method to make it conditional. If the requested resource has not been modified since the time specified in this field, the server SHOULD perform the requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not present.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Max-forward</td>		<td>Provides a mechanism with the TRACE and OPTIONS methods to limit the number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request to the next inbound server. </td></tr>
				<tr><td>Proxy-Authorization</td>	<td>Authorization credentials for connecting to a proxy.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Range</td>			<td>Request only part of an entity. Bytes are numbered from 0.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Referrer</td>			<td>Allows a server to generate lists of back-links to resources for interest, logging, optimized caching, etc. It also allows obsolete or mistyped links to be traced for maintenance. The Referer field MUST NOT be sent if the Request-URI was obtained from a source that does not have its own URI, such as input from the user keyboard.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>User-Agent</td>			<td>Contains information about the user agent originating the request. This is for statistical purposes, the tracing of protocol violations, and automated recognition of user agents for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations. </td></tr>
			</table>
			<h3>Response Header Fields</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Headers with additional information about the response, like its location or about the server itself.</li>
			</ul>
			<table>
				<tr><th>Header name</th>		<th>Description</th></tr>
				<tr><td>Accept-Range</td>		<td>Allows the server to
      indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Age</td>			<td>Conveys the sender's estimate of the
      amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was
      generated at the origin server.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>E-Tag</td>			<td>Used for Web cache validation and conditional requests from browsers for resources. Etags use persistent identification elements (PIE) that have been tagged to the user's browser.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Location</td>			<td>Used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the request or identification of a new resource. </td></tr>
				<tr><td>Proxy-Authenticate</td>		<td>Contains the credentials to authenticate a user agent to a proxy server, usually after the server has responded with a 407 Proxy Authentication Required status and the Proxy-Authenticate header.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Retry-After</td>		<td>Can be used with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client. This field MAY also be used with any 3xx (Redirection) response to indicate the minimum time the user-agent is asked wait before issuing the redirected request.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Server</td>			<td>Contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request. The field can contain multiple product tokens and comments identifying the server and any significant subproducts. The product tokens are listed in order of their significance for identifying the application.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Vary</td>			<td>Indicates the set of request-header fields that fully determines, while the response is fresh, whether a cache is permitted to use the response to reply to a subsequent request without revalidation.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>WWW-Authenticate</td>		<td>The WWW-Authenticate response-header field MUST be included in 401 (Unauthorized) response messages. The field value consists of at least one challenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and parameters applicable to the Request-URI.</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h3>Entity Header Fields</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Headers containing more information about the body of the entity, like its content length or its MIME-type</li>
			</ul>
			<table>
				<tr><th>Header name</th>		<th>Description</th></tr>
				<tr><td>Allow</td>			    <td>Lists the set of methods supported
      by the resource identified by the Request-URI. The purpose of this
      field is strictly to inform the recipient of valid methods
      associated with the resource.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Content-encoding</td>		<td>Used as a modifier to the media-type. Content-Encoding is primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without losing the identity of its underlying media type.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Content-language</td>		<td>Describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. The primary purpose of Content-Language is to allow a user to identify and differentiate entities according to the user's own preferred language.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Content-length</td>		<td>Indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a GET. Applications SHOULD use this field to indicate the transfer-length of the message-body.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Content-location</td>		<td>Used to supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI. </td></tr>
				<tr><td>Content-MD5</td>		<td>An MD5 digest of the entity-body for the purpose of providing an end-to-end message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body. (Note: a MIC is good for detecting accidental modification of the entity-body in transit, but is not proof against malicious attacks.)</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Content-range</td>		<td>The Content-Range entity-header is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Content-type</td>		<td>Indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type that would have been sent had the request been a GET.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Expires</td>			<td>Gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale. A stale cache entry may not normally be returned by a cache (either a proxy cache or a user agent cache) unless it is first validated with the origin server (or with an intermediate cache that has a fresh copy of the entity). </td></tr>
				<tr><td>Last Modified</td>		<td> Indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified.</td></tr>
