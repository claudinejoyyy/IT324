			<h2>HTTP Status Codes</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Informational (1xx)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line.</li>
			</ul>
			<table>
				<tr><th>Status ID</th><th>Status name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
				<tr><td>100</td><td>Continue</td>			<td>used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>101</td><td>Switching Protocols</td>		<td>server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request, via the Upgrade message header field for a change in the application protocol being used</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h3>Success (2xx)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This class of status code indicates that the client's request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.</li>
			</ul>
			<table>
				<tr><th>Status ID</th><th>Status name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
				<tr><td>200</td><td>OK</td>					<td> request has succeeded</td></tr>
				<tr><td>201</td><td>Created</td>				<td>request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created</td></tr>
				<tr><td>202</td><td>Accepted</td>				<td>request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed</td></tr>
				<tr><td>203</td><td>Non-Authoritative Information</td>		<td>returned metainformation in the entity-header is not the definitive set as available from the origin server, but is gathered from a local or a third-party copy</td></tr>
				<tr><td>204</td><td>No Content</td>				<td>server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an entity-body</td></tr>
				<tr><td>205</td><td>Reset Content</td>				<td>server has fulfilled the request and the user agent should reset the document view which caused the request to be sent</td></tr>
				<tr><td>206</td><td>Partial Content</td>			<td>server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h3>Redirection (3xx)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request.</li>
			</ul>
			<table>
				<tr><th>Status ID</th><th>Status name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
				<tr><td>300</td><td>Multiple Choices</td>		<td>requested resource corresponds to any one of a set of representations, each with its own specific location, and agent-driven negotiation information is being provided so that the user can select a preferred representation and redirect its request to that location</td></tr>
				<tr><td>301</td><td>Moved Permanently</td>		<td>requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource should use one of the returned URIs</td></tr>
				<tr><td>302</td><td>Found</td>				<td>requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI</td></tr>
				<tr><td>303</td><td>See Other</td>			<td>response to the request can be found under a different URI and should be retrieved using a GET method on that resource</td></tr>
				<tr><td>304</td><td>Not Modified</td>			<td>the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified</td></tr>
				<tr><td>305</td><td>Use Proxy</td>			<td> requested resource must be accessed through the proxy given by the location field</td></tr>
				<tr><td>306</td><td>(Unused)</td>			<td>is no longer used and the code is reserved</td></tr>
				<tr><td>307</td><td>Temporary Redirect</td>		<td>requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h3>Client Error (4xx)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred.</li>
			</ul>
			<table>
				<tr><th>Status ID</th><th>Status name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
				<tr><td>400</td><td>Bad Request</td>					<td>request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax</td></tr>
				<tr><td>401</td><td>Unauthorized</td>					<td>request requires user authentication</td></tr>
				<tr><td>402</td><td>Payment Required</td>				<td>too primitive to be useful</td></tr>
				<tr><td>403</td><td>Forbidden</td>					<td>server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it</td></tr>
				<tr><td>404</td><td>Not Found</td>					<td>server has not found anything matching the Request-URI</td></tr>
				<tr><td>405</td><td>Method not Allowed</td>				<td>method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the resource identified by the Request-URI</td></tr>
				<tr><td>406</td><td>Not Acceptable</td>					<td>resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request</td></tr>
				<tr><td>407</td><td>Proxy Authentication Required</td>			<td>indicates that the client must first authenticate itself with the proxy</td></tr>
				<tr><td>408</td><td>Request Timeout</td>				<td>client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait</td></tr>
				<tr><td>409</td><td>Conflict</td>					<td>request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource</td></tr>
				<tr><td>410</td><td>Gone</td>						<td>requested resource is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known</td></tr>
				<tr><td>411</td><td>Length Required</td>				<td>server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length</td></tr>
				<tr><td>412</td><td>Precondition Failed</td>				<td>precondition given in one or more of the request-header fields evaluated to false when it was tested on the server</td></tr>
				<tr><td>413</td><td>Request Entity Too Large</td>			<td>server is refusing to process a request because the request entity is larger than the server is willing or able to process</td></tr>
				<tr><td>414</td><td>Request-URI Too Long</td>				<td>server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI is longer than the server is willing to interpret</td></tr>
				<tr><td>415</td><td>Unsupported Media Type</td>				<td>server is refusing to service the request because the entity of the request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method</td></tr>
				<tr><td>416</td><td>Request Range Not Satisfiable</td>			<td>request included a Range request-header field and none of the range-specifier values in this field overlap the current extent of the selected resource, and the request did not include an If-Range request-header field</td></tr>
				<tr><td>417</td><td>Expectation Failed</td>				<td>expectation given in an Expect request-header field could not be met by this server, or, if the server is a proxy, the server has unambiguous evidence that the request could not be met by the next-hop server</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h3>Server Error (5xx)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This class of status code indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the request.</li>
			</ul>
			<table>
				<tr><th>Status ID</th><th>Status name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
				<tr><td>500</td><td>Internal Server Error</td>			<td>server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request</td></tr>
				<tr><td>501</td><td>Not Implemented</td>			<td> server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request</td></tr>
				<tr><td>502</td><td>Bad Gateway</td>				<td>the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request</td></tr>
				<tr><td>503</td><td>Service Unavailable</td>			<td>server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance </td></tr>
				<tr><td>504</td><td>Gateway Timeout</td>			<td>The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server specified by the URI or some other auxiliary server it needed to access in attempting to complete the request</td></tr>
				<tr><td>505</td><td>HTTP Version Not Supported</td>		<td>server does not support, or refuses to support, the HTTP protocol version that was used in the request message</td></tr>
